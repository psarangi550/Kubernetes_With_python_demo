- **Pods In Kubernetes**

    - `pods` are the smallest unit in the `kunbernertes world`
    
    - in case of the `docker world` the `containers` were the smallest unit possible 

    - the `container` exists inside the `pods` , we can create single or multiple `container` inside the `pod`

    - all the `container` inside the `pod` share the `same volume` and `share network resources` such as `IP Address`

    - `container` present in one pod `can't be shared` with `pod` present in another `server` , one `pod` should be `present for one server which can be physical or virtual in nature`
